The above diagram shows how data flows through the garden.  In a few steps, this
is what happens:

1. Gardener receives new data
2. Gardener determines what work needs to happen because of the new data
3. Gardener sends work to Worker
4. Worker does work
5. Worker sends result back to Gardener as new data
6. Repeat
